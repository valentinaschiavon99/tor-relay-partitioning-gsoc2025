This repository supports my proposal for **Google Summer of Code 2025** under **The Tor Project**.

## üìå Summary
The project aims to detect **relay partitioning** in the Tor network using **graph analysis** techniques.  
By modeling relay connectivity as a graph and applying algorithms via **Neo4j GDS**, the system will identify potential partitions that may compromise network integrity.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Neo4j Graph Data Science**
- **Python** for prototyping and data pipelines
- **Rust** for future performance-critical modules
- Graph theory & distributed network principles

## üìÅ Structure
- `/notebooks` ‚Üí test environments and data experiments
- `/docs` ‚Üí diagrams, architecture sketches
- `/proposal.pdf` ‚Üí full GSoC submission

## ü§ù About
This work builds on academic research in **AI governance and cybersecurity**, and represents a step toward contributing to **open-source privacy infrastructure**.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note: This repository is currently in the GSoC 2025 proposal phase.  
Development is exploratory and will follow official coding guidelines upon acceptance.
